in google interviews there's this

famous question that everyone answers wrong they

shrink you down to the size of a coin and

put you in a blender the blades

will start spinning in 60 seconds what

would you do I like to think I can

duck and dodge the blades maybe

break the bottom push the

blender

ask nicely not to turn the

blender tie my clothes together and then use them

as rope I guess if I was light I

could catch an

updraft accept defeat I'm the

size of a coin what quality of

life is that okay resonance I run

into one wall I push it I run to the

other I push it and keep running back and forth

until I knock over the glass

honestly what I would think is I'd try to

get to the center of the blades they're

spinning around me but the

rpm's might not be

that high if I stand in the center I

tie my clothes to one of the

blades when they start spinning I get them to

swing around and then I'm like "Uh but these

answers aren't

[Music]

correct."  I first saw this

problem in this book it describes how

every year Google received around 3

million applications but only

hired 7000 people an

acceptance rate of 0.2%

so one way to filter out millions

of candidates was to use riddles and the

interviewers had fun

making them up we didn't have a list at

that time of questions to ask we

shared the questions with each

other some of them gained

popularity questions like "How many

golf balls fit in a

747?"  Or "How much would you charge to wash

all the windows in Seattle?"

But the blender question got me

hooked and I'm not the only one you lie down and

enjoy it

until those brown ones only run nonstop for

about 10 or 11 hours so we get out

and when we do we'll be better because

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger but there's

this question has been hotly

debated in the comments sections

of Reddit

there are so many different answers but

which one is best

I'll try hiding under the blades

maybe hiding under the blades good

first reaction but maybe that won't

solve your problem completely now

you're trapped in a

running blender maybe you want to escape I can

climb the walls there are defects in the

walls big enough

for me to grab onto there are

Wunderwalls forces strong enough

to connect me to the wall I'm

basically like a geko a geko will

stick to the wall of a blender

even though neither its leg nor the glass are

charged

the geko's leg has to be pressed

firmly against the glass so

those atoms are within a few

nanometers of the atoms in the glass

so in a certain  moment the

electrons in an atom will not be

evenly distributed around the

nucleus they might be slightly more on

one side than the other this causes the

atom to be momentarily slightly

positively charged on one side and

slightly negatively charged on the

other the glass atom next to it

experiences the attraction of this

charge imbalance and a

similar charge imbalance is induced in the

glass atom therefore the

electrons in the glass atom are

attracted towards the nucleus of the

geeko atom and vice versa so there is a

very weak force of attraction between

neutral atoms this is known as the

dewalls force and it is what allows

geekos to stick to walls it is the

same force that holds

graphite together there is no actual bond between the

layers of graphene in a pencil it is rather like a

stack of paper the layers only stick together

because of Wunderwalls forces

these forces are quite weak but

as we are so small perhaps they would be

enough to help us scale up and

out I can almost say with

certainty at that scale we would not stick together and that

is because interactions like the

Vanerwals forces are still small I have

studied  climbing and at a scale

like cockroaches and geckos it turns out

you have to be very special to pull

it off geckos have millions of

tiny branches on their legs that

increase their surface area and

allow them to adapt to surfaces

our hands aren't like that but

ants and cockroaches don't rely on

Wonderwalls forces and they

can still climb

walls so maybe a

miniature human could too the mechanism of

a cockroach's leg and I knew all

about them is absolutely beautiful the

same with ants by the way they have

two little tarsal claws which are what

hit the surface and they really

hit it when they're climbing meters per

second they catch on despite

having no adhesion they have a

very sophisticated friction system these claws

can grab onto almost anything

even glass although glass

looks smooth to us

it's actually covered in tiny

surface imperfections and at the scale of an

insect these features are

significant

ants do have climbing gear they

do use like little axes to

hack their way through we don't have the

gripping discs or whatever or

special claws or

Banderws forces no no we don't have claws if you're

that size fingers are claws we only

have two claws really and then

our feet are no good for climbing I do

n't know well but at that scale I don't

know imagine putting a little spike on your

foot or sharpening your shoes or

heels and you're going to be all set now I'm

climbing in heels but there's still a

problem I have to be very careful as I

slowly place my hands and feet it will

take me more than 60 seconds to

get out and in that time the blades

will have started spinning an error and I'm

a

smoothie google I was searching for a

different answer now I'm going to the

physics building maybe they know no I don't have

anything I'm drawing a blank this is embarrassing

we're in the last year of our degree we

should know this I think maybe I

could run around and throw myself

out okay if we're just talking about

entropy it should increase at some

point there should be some kind of chaos

no system will remain

unchanged take that to the limit of

infinity and I'll freeze using that

logic if I just extrapolate that that's still

too big to be able to

quantum tunnel or something wow  woo woo

woo that's

overthinking it's actually not that

complicated do you want to hear the best

answer I've ever heard yeah just jump just jump

how would that work just jump

how and is it going to work will it jump where

out of the blender up

who told you that is crazy right does

that make sense to you no it doesn't

but do you want to know what it works for

yeah tell me how it works jumping out

of the blender seems impossible because

at the size of a coin the wall of a

blender is 15 times your height it would be

like jumping over an

eight story building but check out these

videos did you notice

a horse a dog and a squirrel all

jumped roughly the same

height this is precisely what

Alfonso Boreli the father of

biomechanics studied back in the 10th century according to

him under the same conditions the

smallest and lightest animals make

larger jumps in relation to their

body all other

conditions being equal and in fact the limbs

and the other organs are in the same

proportion the dog will jump as far

as the horse now of course there are

variations a species whose

survival  It depends on the jump it will be

optimized for it whereas others

like tortoises and elephants don't

jump at all but when you

consider the huge variations in

size I mean a horse is 15

times heavier than a squirrel it's

incredible that they jump more or less the

same height and it's not because squirrels

are super muscular or anything like that

the percentages of muscle to

weight of horses and squirrels

are similar and even insects

have less muscle in relation to their

weight why do you think an ant

can lift 50 times its own

weight is it because it's more muscular do

you go to the gym come on you're more

muscular than an ant how are

small things so strong well if you

look closely a muscle is

made up of tiny units

called sarcomeres they act like

little springs how hard

a muscle contracts depends on how many of these

springs are in series but the strength

of a muscle solely depends on

how many are working in parallel so

the thicker the muscle the more

springs there are in parallel the greater the

force therefore strength depends on

the cross section of a muscle and  as

animals get

smaller this cross-sectional area

decreases according to the square of

their height but the weight of an animal is

proportional to its volume so it

decreases with the cube of its height

so as you get smaller the weight

decreases faster than the force and

as a result smaller animals

have a much greater force to weight ratio

yeah maybe you could lift your

own weight like if you put

your body weight on your back and carried it you

could lift 100 times yeah come on

and for us stuck in the

blender that













extra force relative to our weight means we could jump right out your surface area decreases according to the square you'd be a little Superman I see okay that's cool so I could literally jump out of the blender I could jump out of the blender but in

movies and games where

people get shrunk they hardly ever show it

that way honey I shrunk the kids

was one of my favorite movies as a

kid I love it tiny people

struggle to lift scissors the

raindrops nearly crush them if

it was scientifically accurate they would

actually have super strength most

people don't think about this  When you first

hear the question the answer

seems too simple. When you ask the

right questions, you define the problem,

there are some really obvious solutions

that work. And that's true for a

lot of problems in the real world. I

'm all for obvious solutions.

But from the get-go, the idea of

jumping didn't really convince me. Even this idea

of ​​jumping out of the blender doesn't make

sense to me because jumping isn't just

about how strong you are in relation to your

weight. It's also about timing, your

kinetics and all that. How long are you

in contact with the ground? How much force can

you apply in one burst in a

very short period? Would it be fair to say that you

're

overthinking it? You have to suspend your

disbelief at some point. I think

if you consider all the possible

challenges that a human would have. If they

suddenly became that size, they didn't have

time to train their legs and things

like that, in that new environment, I don't see

much of a chance of them jumping out.

Sometimes people

overcomplicate things and that can be

problematic. I would like to see, I don't know, a

realistic model where I'm shrunk down 100

times. Could I jump higher? I want to see

somebody do those

physics equations, so could I jump higher?  but

not 100 times taller you know that's why

we've called on researchers at

Georgiatch's biomechanics lab

to investigate we have our

simulated blender we're 2cm

tall and we have to jump at least

30cm to get out I thought "Okay what if it was me I

'm pretty embarrassingly

unathletic what would happen if I did that?"  And I

did it right here next to my desk

my partner measured my jump height and I know

how much I weigh and all that so how would it work out for

me if we have a person

who weighs 84 kg squats 15 cm and jumps to

a height of 27 cm that person if they were

reduced to 1% of their original size would

jump 42 cm high the

simple simulation shows a jump height of 42

cm so they would make it out but we

need to consider

air resistance since our

cross section is now 100 times

larger relative to our weight the

resistance should have a

bigger effect if you measure what a coin if

before the jumper managed a 42

cm jump with resistance considering this

resistance then it's about 39 cm

so we decrease the jump height a little bit

but that resistance calculation

assumes that the jump is perfectly

vertical but what happens if you're a little bit

uncoordinated and you turn around mid-

jump well then you expose 10 times

more surface area and that increases

the amount of air resistance if

you were to somehow turn around and still get

you would move upwards what would be

the air resistance then eh by

doing that does that mean a jump height

of 22 cm oh then no no ah gee if

suddenly you feel very confident and you

want to do a somersault while you're

jumping you're not going to make it don't get out of

the blender with a somersault it's

good it's good advice don't try to

show off the idea is that it doesn't crush you

better first your head getting out of the

machine is not the important thing it's what

happens then they have two coin sized men

free in the world how many

possibilities the simulation is here if you

can jump out of the blender

okay okay I'm glad we

did uh this exercise do you want me to

do another month of research on

this no you've already done quite a bit you've



convinced myself I feel like jumping is an

unsatisfactory answer it was

unsatisfactory when you

first mentioned it and then you went you did

the simulation you got the model and you

said "Look our little person can

jump 40 cm does that convince you and I well

yes but my sense was rattling it was

seriously something is wrong here are you

telling me that I have to apply a

force in a  thousandth of a second and I

have to withstand 278

G-forces I'm not going to survive that now I

understand that my intuition was good I think

everyone guessed that you can't jump

out of a blender I think they're

right and you could say that's

overthinking it but that's precisely

the point of the puzzle overthinking to

get to the point where you're

considering the details of what would

actually be feasible a lot of things would

go wrong our hearts have to

generate a certain amount of pressure

to get the blood up to the head and

down to the feet if you take the

human heart and you shrink it down it's not going to be

able to generate the same forces I think there would

be a catastrophe at a smaller

size controlling the air pressure

inside these myriad sacs in

our lungs there's an

exquisite balance there now you try to take that

same design and compress it I'm skeptical

about the possibility of keeping the

airways open you

couldn't even think about this because you wouldn't

have the brain structures that we

have you can't fit 86 billion

neurons into the volume of a coin you also

can't shrink the cells that's the

issue cells are  cells jumping

seems like the only option but I don't

think you can jump because you can't

breathe and your heart can't pump

blood you just collapse and die

before you can jump okay so if

you're a biologist you think we would die if you

're a physicist you can decide if we would be

little Supermen or like I think

unable to fully harness

our extra strength Borelli who knew didn't

even have a

blender he doesn't know about that stress but

if you're an interviewer at Google you might not

even care what the

answer is I think a misconception

that candidates have is to think that

when they're being asked that it's because they

want to see if they can solve the

problem actually it's not like that there are five

attributes that people look for

addressing

ambiguity breaking down the problem being

creative being smart and

communication so none of those

five is that it's correct yes we are the

fools who decided to figure out what

the best answer was well

yeah

Google realized that asking these

kinds of questions didn't make much sense

the boc the senior vice president of

people operations at Google had

this to say: "In

hiring we found that

puzzles are a total waste of

time how many  golf balls fit on

an airplane how many gas stations are in

Manhattan a complete waste of time does

n't predict anything they basically serve to make

the interviewer feel

smart but I feel like there's a

moment where you say "You're going to admit

you're wrong."  And I'm like, "Oh,

you know, I think this goes beyond whether

I'm wrong."  That's a crazy

question, it's crazy and I think it has to

do with what you're saying, your point

is that riddles like this are not good

ways to test whether people know

what they're talking about. While

riddles are useless for testing

job candidates, they are useful

for something. Every time we ask this

question to people on the street, to

physics students and to scientists, they get

enlightened. They have to try to see the

world from a new perspective and it's

precisely this way of thinking about it that has

led to some of the greatest

scientific discoveries. Einstein

used thought experiments to

develop his theory of relativity.

Oiler's solution to the

Conixber bridge problem is what inspired

graph theory. And when Schordinger

wanted to illustrate his problems with

quantum mechanics, he imagined a cat in a

torture box. It's true that the

blender question is silly, but

silly questions can produce

profound answers and show us something

new. I believe that to learn something new

you must be willing to accept the

ridiculous and go with the flow.
